  - Authored the comprehensive Institutional Admin Handbook in [`docs/admin/ADMIN_HANDBOOK.md`](file:///c:/Users/syedh/.gemini/antigravity/scratch/educompass/docs/admin/ADMIN_HANDBOOK.md) documenting core golden rules, role hierarchy, operator/chairman/VC SOPs, publish cascade flow, and disaster recovery emergency rollback procedures.
  - Monorepo validation: **180/180 Vitest tests green**, 0 TypeScript errors across all 6 workspace packages, Next.js 15 production build succeeds cleanly for all 22/22 routes.

- **Institutional Admin Panel — Dashboards & Help System (Card A11)**:
  - Built endpoint `GET /api/v1/admin/health/report` in `apps/api/src/routes/health-report.ts` computing data health diagnostics across catalog courses, unreviewed FYPs, cooling-off items, and prerequisite DAG acyclic integrity.
  - Upgraded frontend console in `apps/web/src/app/admin/page.tsx` into a multi-role institutional experience (Section 11):
    - **Operator Workspace**: "My Drafts" table, "My Submitted Requests" tracker with deterministic message generation popups (Section 4.3), allowed modules entry tiles, and locked modules tooltips ("Why can't I do this?").

  - Built router `apps/api/src/routes/deletions.ts` mounted under `/api/v1/admin/deletions`:
    - Resource cooling-off duration resolver (`getCoolingOffDays`): Career/Chatbot (7 days), FYP/Professors (14 days), Curriculum (30 days), Schemes (90 days).
    - Soft deletion staging `POST /`: Sets `deleted_at = NOW()` immediately on the target table (hiding item from students) and inserts into `deletion_schedule`.
    - Scheduled deletions queue `GET /`: Lists items with real-time countdown timer (`hoursRemaining`) and department scoping.
    - Restoration before purge `POST /:id/restore`: Clears `deleted_at = null`, marks `state = 'restored'`, and records audit trail.
    - Final purge `POST /:id/purge` (Golden Rule 3): Enforces VC-only role, step-up token challenge, cooling-off elapsed date, daily rate cap (maximum 5 purges per 24 hours), permanent row deletion, and immutable tombstone logged in `audit_log`.
  - Tests-first test suite in `apps/api/src/routes/deletions.test.ts` (8/8 tests passing).
  - Monorepo validation: **168/168 Vitest tests green**, 0 TypeScript errors across all 6 workspace packages.

- **Institutional Admin Panel — Publish Cascade Execution & VC Rollback (Card A9)**:
  - Built background cascade execution engine `apps/api/src/lib/publish-cascade.ts`:
    - Handles sequential steps 3 to 10 (`rebuild_graph`, `recompute_scores`, `refresh_caches`, `reembed_chatbot`, `faq_staleness`, `career_links`, `student_notice`, `health_report`).
    - Full idempotency: skips already completed jobs without duplicate runs or data corruption.
    - Side job failure isolation: failures record error details in `publish_jobs.detail` without aborting or rolling back the live publish (Section 8).
    - Batch runner `runPendingJobs()` for release processing.
  - Built router `apps/api/src/routes/releases-jobs.ts` mounted under `/api/v1/admin`:
    - `GET /releases`: Paginated release list with department scoping.
    - `GET /releases/:id`: Release detail view displaying snapshot and associated cascade jobs.
    - `POST /releases/:id/rollback`: Atomic rollback endpoint requiring step-up token and VC role authorization; creates immutable `rollback-*` release tag and enqueues cascade steps 3-10 without rewriting history.
    - `GET /jobs`: Cascade job monitoring queue with status and release filters.
    - `POST /jobs/:id/retry`: Re-executes failed or queued jobs.
    - `POST /jobs/run`: Manual trigger for pending queue execution.
  - Tests-first test suite in `apps/api/src/lib/publish-cascade.test.ts` (4 tests) and `apps/api/src/routes/releases-jobs.test.ts` (4 tests).
  - Monorepo validation: **160/160 Vitest tests green**, 0 TypeScript errors across all 6 workspace packages.

- **Institutional Admin Panel — Curriculum Admin & Validation Engine (Card A8)**:
  - Built router `apps/api/src/routes/admin-curriculum.ts` mounted under `/api/v1/admin/curriculum`:
    - Strict role access guard (`requireCurriculumRole`) blocking data-entry operators with 403 (Section 3).
    - Pure TypeScript curriculum validation engine (`validateCurriculumDraft`) verifying Section 14 Test 5 criteria:
      - Circular prerequisite dependency detection via directed graph DFS traversal.
      - Backward prerequisite detection (flagging prerequisites placed in same or later semester).
      - Semester credit hour limit validation (flagging terms exceeding max credits, e.g. 21).
      - Grade scale validity checks (ensuring passing grade exists in scale).
    - Scheme cloning endpoint `POST /versions/:id/clone` duplicating published schemes into isolated draft revisions with course placements.
    - Draft validation endpoint `POST /versions/:id/validate`.
    - Impact preview endpoint `GET /versions/:id/impact` analyzing courses added, removed, shifted between terms, and estimating affected student batch counts with privacy-preserving small group suppression (<5).
    - Course equivalences listing endpoint `GET /equivalences`.
  - Tests-first test suite in `apps/api/src/routes/admin-curriculum.test.ts` (7/7 tests passing).
  - Monorepo validation: **152/152 Vitest tests green**, 0 TypeScript errors across all 6 workspace packages.

- **Institutional Admin Panel — Content Modules & Draft Transformers (Card A7)**:
  - Built router `apps/api/src/routes/admin-content.ts` mounted under `/api/v1/admin/content`:
    - Strict module entitlement middleware checking operator `allowed_modules` from institutional session.
    - Department-scoped paginated reads (`GET /:module`) with hard 100-record cap and zero student PII exposure.
    - Golden Rule 1 enforcement: `POST /:module/draft` never writes to live tables directly; fetches `before_state`, classifies impact (`minor` vs `major`), and stages insertions/updates/deletions into `change_items` under a draft `change_set`.
    - Single item inspection `GET /:module/:id` overlaying pending draft change requests.
    - Data imports queue (`GET /imports/queue`) and staging endpoint (`POST /imports/:id/stage`) adhering to Rule 2 (extracted -> approved -> published).
  - Tests-first test suite in `apps/api/src/routes/admin-content.test.ts` (10/10 tests passing).
  - Monorepo validation: **145/145 Vitest tests green**, 0 TypeScript errors across all 6 workspace packages.

    - **Phase 1 (Verified Answers)**: Authored all 100 institutional answers across 5 answer modes (`static_kb`, `data_query`, `engine_call`, `tool_flow`, `guardrail`) adhering strictly to plain language, <80 words, source labels (`database`, `roadmap`), estimate disclaimers, and Rule 3 (zero student PII), saved in `docs/data/faq/faq_answers.json`.
    - **Phase 2 (Paraphrase Expansion)**: Generated 1,100 active variants (typos, Roman Urdu, keyword forms, slot variations) in `docs/data/faq/faq_variants.json`, and an isolated held-out test set of 500 cases in `docs/data/faq/faq_held_out_test_set.json`.
    - **Phase 3 (Matcher Engine & Offline Execution)**: Built `FAQMatcher` in `apps/api/src/lib/faq-matcher.ts` with text normalization (Roman Urdu & acronyms), slot extraction (`course`, `track`, `program`, `semester`, `target`), token recall + trigram similarity scoring, and near-miss protection (D01 vs D02 vs E02; E03 vs E04; G01 vs G02; F05 vs F11).
    - **Phase 4 & 5 (Validation & Storage)**: Added automated test suite `apps/api/src/lib/faq-matcher.test.ts` (16/16 tests passing, >85% accuracy on held-out set, zero PII privacy scan passing). Integrated with Express `/api/v1/chat` Layer 1. Generated complete database migration `supabase/migrations/20261028000001_faq_preload_system.sql`.

## Decisions
- D1 architecture: SRS-literal — Next.js (web) + Express (API) + FastAPI (pipeline/Python services)
- D2 scraping: scripted offline scraping (Python) + optional offline LLM parse, always human-reviewed
- D3 FYP generator: LLM-powered using Gemini free tier, seeded from scraped real FYP data
- D4 graph library: @xyflow/react (React Flow) + Framer Motion
- D5 LLM chain: Gemini → xAI/Grok / Groq → preloaded answers/retrieval fallback; embeddings via Gemini text-embedding-004 (dim 768)
- D6 Student names: NEVER stored anywhere — redacted at extraction time (Playbook v2 Section 2)
- D7 data-engineer.pdf: goes inside Data Science and Back-End tracks, not a 13th track (Decision C)
- D8 Roadmap progress key: (user, track_slug, topic_key) — not step_id — so variant switches keep ticks
- D9 (Decision E) FYDP outcome default: **accepted** if no status shown; follow status column if present; rejected only if explicitly stated
- D10 (Decision F) Programs covered: CSE, CS, SE only — all computing fields. Other engineering = out_of_scope
- D11 (Decision B) Permission: Ram granted permission for all 5 FYDP PDFs. Recorded in docs/permissions/PERMISSIONS.md
- D12 (Decision D) Roadmap licences: all PDFs are from roadmap.sh (open source). Attribute in source field and UI. No licence issue.

- Installed pdfplumber, pypdf, pytest into conda env (CAMPUSXHURRAIM / Python 3.13.14)
- Created `pipeline/__init__.py` and `pipeline/core/__init__.py` (Python packages)
- Wrote `pipeline/core/profiler.py` — full Phase 0 PDF profiler
- Wrote `pipeline/core/test_profiler.py` — 23 unit tests, all passing
- Ran profiler against all 14 PDFs (5 FYP + 9 roadmaps)
- Generated `pipeline/reports/phase_0_profile_report.md` and `phase_0_profiles_raw.json`

Phase 0 results:
- FYP tables detected: 25 | Approx rows: ~288
- PII flags: 1 (FYP 2022.pdf — 140 roll-number matches detected and marked for discard)
- Roadmap PDFs: all 9 profiled, no PII, topic-node counts: 124–242 lines per PDF
- Column layout: 2022 FYP uses [Name, Roll No.] in first table row; 2022-2025 SOP lists use [Student Name] — all marked DROP

## Session 2026-10-25 continued (Antigravity) — Phase 1
Did:
- Wrote `pipeline/core/extractor.py` — full Phase 1 FYP extractor
- Wrote `pipeline/core/test_extractor.py` — 51 unit tests, all passing
- Fixed `pipeline/vocab/domains.json` — added healthcare keywords (retinopathy, diabetic, screening, icu, rehabilitation, wearable)
- Fixed `pipeline/core/privacy_validator.py` — added exempt fields list so structural fields (source_file, schema_version etc.) don't trigger roll-number false positives
- All 90 pipeline tests passing (51 extractor + 23 profiler + 16 validator)
- Ran extractor against all 5 FYP PDFs:
  - fyp_2022.jsonl:     36 records
  - fyp_sop_2022.jsonl:  8 records
  - fyp_sop_2023.jsonl:  8 records
  - fyp_sop_2024.jsonl:  8 records
  - fyp_sop_2025.jsonl:  8 records
  - TOTAL: 68 records | 0 PII rejected | 0 dropped
- All records: status=extracted, outcome=accepted (D9), PII keys absent (D6)

Known edge case: "industrial" keyword causes some CS projects to be tagged out_of_scope
  → These will be reviewed and corrected in the Admin review queue (status: extracted → approved)
  → No data is published without Ram's approval

Next step options:
  A) Phase 2 — Loader: push extracted JSONL to Supabase fyp_projects table (requires .env with DB creds)
  B) Card F3 — Auth & Access Control (Supabase Auth + requireRole helper)
  C) Card E1 — Design System (apps/ui package, typography, tokens)

Flags for Ram:
- Decision B: Written permission note added to `docs/permissions/PERMISSIONS.md` ✅
- Decision E: Default accepted confirmed by Ram ✅
- Decision F: Programs confirmed: CSE, CS, SE ✅
- Decision D: Roadmap licence confirmed: roadmap.sh (open source) ✅
- Open: Full-resolution course chart image verified with JSON ✅
- Open: Scheme of Studies PDF (prerequisite engine is blocked without it)

Decisions made this session:
- D6: Student names — NEVER stored (confirmed from Playbook v2)
- D7: data-engineer.pdf → inside existing tracks, not 13th track
- D8: Roadmap progress keyed by (user, track_slug, topic_key) for variant-switch persistence
- D9: FYDP outcome default: accepted unless status says otherwise
- D10: Programs covered: CSE, CS, SE only
- D11: Permission granted for 5 FYDP PDFs (recorded in docs/permissions/PERMISSIONS.md)
- D12: Roadmap PDFs are open source (roadmap.sh)

Next step: Choose next card:
- Option A: **F3 (Auth)** — NextAuth / Supabase Auth session integration, user profiles, role protection middleware
- Option B: **F4 / X4 (Data Pipeline - Phase 0 Profiles)** — Profile the 5 FYP PDFs and roadmaps, generate Phase 0 report
